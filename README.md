### ALA (Automated Language Analysis)

This repository contains a module and some scripts for Automated Language Analysis (ALA), primarily focused on the Slovenian language. However, much of its functionality can be directly applied to other languages as well.

The repository is not optimized for speed but tries to be accessible to linguists with little prior experience in Python and computing.

The module is `ala.py`.

An usage example is in `ccKresExample.py` (see [ccKresExample.md](ccKresExample.md))

## Additional Notes

- Ensure required Python packages (e.g., `classla`, `numpy`,`pandas`,`openpyxl`,`matplotlib`) are installed.
- Processing time depends on corpus size and system performance.

Happy analyzing!
