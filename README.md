### ALA (Automated Language Analysis)

This repository contains a module called `ala.py` along with scripts for Automated Language Analysis (ALA), primarily focused on the Slovenian language. However, much of its functionality can be directly applied to other languages as well.

The repository tries to be accessible to linguists with little or no prior experience in Python or computing.
